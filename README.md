<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/bginf)

BGinfo is a tool to show various information on your desktop wallpaper. The Screenshot above you shows the output of the included config.bgi. We deploy this configuration file to all our virtual machines in Azure to set a company standard. The information helps us to be always aware of which server you are currently interacting. Especially during troubleshooting sessions, the information on the desktop helps us double-check our work by managing various tasks between open RDP sessions.

Feel free to modify the ```config.bgi``` with your settings and information and maybe share a desktop screenshot. There are so many different demands and requirements to put information on a desktop that I am curious to see what kind of different layouts and information people put into the ```config.bgi``` configuration.

Also, sharing WMI, RegKeys, etc. or other kinds of individual information/integrations, you get out of your system to show it on your desktop could be beneficial and exciting to see for all of us.


### Built With

* [BGInfo by Windows Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/bginfo)
* [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
* [Azuer PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-4.4.0)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.



### Prerequisites

You need an installed [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) or, if you like to do it on Microsoft Visual Studio Code, you can try the Remote-Connection and let the code run in an isolated Docker container. Find the instruction of how to run here [Using Azure PowerShell in Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/azureps-in-docker?view=azps-4.4.0). It can be helpful if you use a macOS or Linux.

Running the script in the end, you need the Azure "AZ" module installed. Here the simple installation (it works the same way in the Docker container)
[InstallAzure Module "AZ"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-4.4.0)
```powershell
if ($PSVersionTable.PSEdition -eq 'Desktop' -and (Get-Module -Name AzureRM -ListAvailable)) {
    Write-Warning -Message ('Az module not installed. Having both the AzureRM and ' +
      'Az modules installed at the same time is not supported.')
} else {
    Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
}
```

Now, you are ready to go!



### Installation
 
1. Clone the ps-azure-bginfo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/adminph-de/ps-azure-bginfo.git
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Modify the JSON file ```bginfo.json``` and put in your variable values with your favorit tool (as example Microsoft Visual Studio Code):
```json
[
    {
       "bginfo": {
           "location": "westeurope",
           "resourcegroup": "myRG",
           "vmname": "myVm"
     }
    }
]
````

3. Execute the script with you preferred way of doing it (as an example, with Visual Studio Code):
> Don't forget to do a ```Login-AzAccount``` and a ```Select-AzSubscription``` if you have more than one Subscription, **before** you run the script.

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot-run]

4. Copy the ```config.bgi``` file 
Finally you can copy the ```config.bgi``` configuration to the virutal machine or you keep the setup as it is and stick to the Azure default or you customize your own config file. If you like to copy it, find the installed Azure Extention in ```C:\Packages\``` on the virtual machine you did the installation.
